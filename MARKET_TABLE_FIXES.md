# Market Table Implementation - Fixes Applied

## Issue
The table was showing "Error loading matches - Failed to fetch" because the client-side component was trying to directly call `http://localhost:8000/market` which has CORS restrictions.

## Solution
Created a Next.js API route (`/api/market`) that acts as a proxy between the frontend and the backend API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created API Route: `app/api/market/route.ts`
- Server-side proxy to bypass CORS
- Forwards requests to backend with proper auth headers
- Handles errors gracefully
- Returns standardized response format

### 2. Updated Component: `components/ui/odds-prediction-table.tsx`
- Changed from direct backend call to Next.js API route (`/api/market`)
- Added data adapter to normalize API response to `MarketMatch` format
- Handles various possible API response formats flexibly

### 3. Table Structure
The table is now positioned correctly below the marquee ticker:
- Marquee Ticker (Line 199)
- Odds & Predictions Table Section (Lines 201-214)
- Platform Stats (Line 217+)

## How It Works

1. **Frontend makes request**: `GET /api/market?status=upcoming&limit=20`
2. **Next.js API route** receives the request
3. **API route forwards** to backend: `GET http://localhost:8000/market?...`
4. **Backend responds** with match data
5. **API route returns** the data to frontend
6. **Frontend adapts** the raw data to `MarketMatch` format
7. **Table displays** the matches

## Features
- ✅ Server-side proxy (no CORS issues)
- ✅ Flexible data adapter (handles various API formats)
- ✅ Error handling with retry button
- ✅ Loading states with skeleton
- ✅ Empty states
- ✅ Auto-refresh every 60s (upcoming) or 30s (live)
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Responsive (desktop table, mobile cards)

## Testing
The table should now load successfully. If the backend API is not running, it will show:
- "Error loading matches" with a retry button
- Or show empty state if no matches are returned

## Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKET_KEY=betgenius_secure_key_2024
```
