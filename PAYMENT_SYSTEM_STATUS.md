- The database is updated with all purchase records as expected.
- All post-payment flows (credits, notifications, emails) are fully functional.

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Payment Flow Architecture**
```
1. User selects payment method →
2. Frontend calls /api/payments/create-payment-intent →
3. Server creates Stripe PaymentIntent →
4. Frontend renders PaymentElement →
5. User completes payment →
6. Stripe sends webhook to /api/payments/webhook →
7. Server processes webhook and delivers content (credits, notifications, emails)
```

### **Webhook Processing Logic**
```typescript
// app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts
case "payment_intent.succeeded":
  await handlePaymentSuccess(event.data.object as Stripe.PaymentIntent)
  break

async function handlePaymentSuccess(paymentIntent: Stripe.PaymentIntent) {
  // Creates user packages or processes tip purchases
  // Updates user account with purchased content
  // Sends confirmation emails and notifications
}
```

### **Database Models**
- `UserPackage`: Stores purchased packages with tip counts and expiration
- `UserPrediction`: Links users to purchased predictions
- `QuickPurchase`: Individual tip items for purchase
- `PackageOffer`: Package definitions with pricing

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Verification**

- Webhook events are received and processed (see Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks > Recent deliveries)
- Users receive purchased tips/packages and credits immediately
- Payment confirmation emails and in-app notifications are sent
- Database is updated with all purchase records
