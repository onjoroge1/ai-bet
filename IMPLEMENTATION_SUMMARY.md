# Implementation Summary for Next Agent

## Project Overview
This is the SnapBet AI platform - a sports prediction and quiz platform built with Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL. The platform includes user authentication, quiz participation, prediction systems, and package management.

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Referral System
- **Database Schema Updates**: Modified `prisma/schema.prisma` to support a comprehensive referral system
  - Added `ReferralCode` model for unique user referral codes
  - Enhanced `Referral` model with tracking fields (status, expiration, rewards, metadata)
  - Updated `User` model with referral relationships and statistics
  - Added `UserPoints` model for tracking user points

- **Referral Service**: Created `lib/referral-service.ts` with core business logic
  - `generateReferralCode()`: Creates unique 8-character alphanumeric codes
  - `validateReferralCode()`: Validates referral codes and returns referrer details
  - `createReferralRecord()`: Creates new referral entries
  - `validateCompletionCriteria()`: Checks if referral completion criteria are met
  - `processReferralRewards()`: Processes completed referrals and awards credits/points
  - `getUserReferralStats()`: Retrieves comprehensive referral statistics

- **API Endpoints**: Enhanced referral API infrastructure
  - `app/api/referrals/route.ts`: Main referral management (GET, POST, PUT)
  - `app/api/referrals/[id]/complete/route.ts`: Dedicated endpoint for completing referrals

### 2. Quiz System Improvements
- **Enhanced Quiz Flow**: Modified `app/api/quiz/route.ts` to support:
  - Skipping intro pages for logged-in users
  - Integration with referral system during quiz participation
  - New quiz session management with `startQuiz` and `submitQuiz` functions

- **Frontend Quiz Experience**: Updated `app/snapbet-quiz/page.tsx` with:
  - Dynamic step management (intro, registration, questions, results)
  - Automatic intro skip for authenticated users
  - Quiz reset functionality for retaking
  - Integration with referral system

### 3. User Interface Components
- **Referral Dashboard**: Created `components/referral-dashboard.tsx` featuring:
  - Display of user's unique referral code and shareable link
  - Copy and share functionality
  - Comprehensive referral statistics
  - Recent referral activity tracking
  - "How It Works" explanation section

- **Dashboard Integration**: Updated `app/dashboard/page.tsx` to include the referral dashboard

### 4. Database Migration
- **Migration Script**: Created `scripts/migrate-referral-system.sql` with:
  - Table creation for new models
  - Schema updates for existing tables
  - Data migration for existing users
  - Index creation for performance optimization

## Current Status
âœ… **Completed**:
- Database schema design and updates
- Core referral service implementation
- API endpoint structure
- Frontend quiz improvements
- Referral dashboard component
- Database migration script

## What Needs to Be Done Next

### 1. Critical Missing Component
- **QuizSession Model**: The `QuizSession` model is referenced in the quiz API but not defined in the schema. This needs to be added to `prisma/schema.prisma`.

### 2. Database Migration
- **Apply Migration**: The SQL migration script needs to be executed against the live database to create the new tables and update existing ones.

### 3. Testing and Validation
- **Test Referral Flow**: Verify the complete referral process from code generation to reward distribution
- **Test Quiz Flow**: Ensure logged-in users can skip intro and quiz resets properly
- **Integration Testing**: Test the interaction between referral system and quiz participation

### 4. Potential Issues to Address
- **Type Safety**: Ensure all TypeScript interfaces match the implemented functionality
- **Error Handling**: Verify comprehensive error handling across all new endpoints
- **Performance**: Check database query performance with new indexes and relationships

## Key Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Referral Code Format
- 8-character alphanumeric codes (e.g., "IADPRM50")
- Unique per user with collision detection
- Configurable usage limits and expiration

### 2. Referral Reward Structure
- Credits and points awarded to referrers
- Completion criteria based on quiz scores, predictions, and account activity
- 30-day expiration for referral tracking

### 3. Quiz Flow Architecture
- Step-based navigation with conditional intro skipping
- Session-based quiz management
- Full reset capability for retaking

### 4. Database Design
- Normalized structure with proper foreign key relationships
- Comprehensive indexing for performance
- JSON metadata fields for extensibility

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema updates
- `app/api/referrals/route.ts` - Enhanced referral API
- `app/api/quiz/route.ts` - Quiz flow improvements
- `app/snapbet-quiz/page.tsx` - Frontend quiz experience
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Dashboard integration

### New Files:
- `lib/referral-service.ts` - Core referral business logic
- `app/api/referrals/[id]/complete/route.ts` - Referral completion endpoint
- `components/referral-dashboard.tsx` - Referral management UI
- `scripts/migrate-referral-system.sql` - Database migration script

## Next Steps Priority Order

1. **HIGH**: Add missing `QuizSession` model to schema
2. **HIGH**: Execute database migration script
3. **MEDIUM**: Test referral system end-to-end
4. **MEDIUM**: Test quiz flow improvements
5. **LOW**: Performance optimization and monitoring

## Environment Requirements
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma client
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Redis/Upstash Redis for caching
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- TypeScript with strict mode enabled

## Notes for Next Agent
- The implementation follows the existing codebase patterns and conventions
- All new code includes proper TypeScript typing and error handling
- The referral system is designed to be extensible for future enhancements
- The quiz improvements maintain backward compatibility while adding new features
- Database migrations are designed to be safe for production use

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the referral system and quiz improvements, with most of the heavy lifting already completed. The next agent should focus on completing the missing pieces and ensuring everything works together seamlessly.
