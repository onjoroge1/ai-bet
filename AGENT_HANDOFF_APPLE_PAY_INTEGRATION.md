## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Apple Pay Configuration Changes**

#### **1. Domain Verification**
```bash
# File created: public/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association
# Purpose: Proves domain ownership to Apple for Apple Pay
```

#### **2. Payment Intent API Fix**
**Before** (causing errors):
```typescript
payment_method_options: {
  apple_pay: { request_three_d_secure: 'automatic' },
  google_pay: { request_three_d_secure: 'automatic' }
}
```

**After** (working):
```typescript
automatic_payment_methods: { 
  enabled: true,
  allow_redirects: 'never'
}
```

#### **3. Stripe Elements Configuration**
```typescript
// QuickPurchaseModal.tsx
<Elements 
  options={{ 
    paymentMethodOrder: ['apple_pay', 'google_pay', 'card'],
    wallets: {
      applePay: 'auto',
      googlePay: 'auto',
    },
  }}
>
```

#### **4. PaymentElement Configuration**
```typescript
// PaymentForm.tsx
<PaymentElement 
  options={{
    paymentMethodOrder: ['apple_pay', 'google_pay', 'card'],
    wallets: {
      applePay: 'auto',
      googlePay: 'auto',
    },
  }}
/>
```

### **Homepage Metrics Changes**

#### **Before vs After**
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Primary Stat | €2.8M User Profits | 450 AI Predictions This Week |
| Secondary Stat | 15,000+ Active Users | 1000+ CLV Opportunities |
